        <p class="brief-about__text">CrypText is a versatile website that empowers you to encrypt text messages using
            two different encryption methods: Caesar and Vigenere. Encrypting your text messages offers
            several advantages, for more information, please check our <a href="./about.html" class="brief-about__link"

            <h2 class="caesar-about__title-two">Caesar Cipher</h2>
            <p class="brief-about__text">In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift
                cipher, Caesar's code, or
                Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of
                substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of
                positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would
                become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private
                correspondence.

                The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes,
                such as the Vigenère cipher, and still has modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all
                single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers
                essentially no communications security.</p>

            <h2 class="vigenere-about__title-two">Vigenere Cipher</h2>
            <p class="brief-about__text">The Vigenère cipher is a method of
                encrypting alphabetic text where each letter of the plaintext is encoded with a different Caesar cipher,
                whose increment is determined by the corresponding letter of another text, the key.

                For example, if the plaintext is attacking tonight and the key is OCULORHINOLARINGOLOGY, then

                the first letter a of the plaintext is shifted by 14 positions in the alphabet (because the first letter
                O of the key is the 14th letter of the alphabet, counting from 0), yielding o;
                the second letter t is shifted by 2 (because the second letter C of the key means 2) yielding v;
                the third letter t is shifted by 20 (U) yielding n, with wrap-around;
                and so on; yielding the message ovnlqbpvt eoeqtnh. If the recipient of the message knows the key, they
                can recover the plaintext by reversing this process.

                The Vigenère cipher is therefore a special case of a polyalphabetic substitution.[1][2]

                First described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553, the cipher is easy to understand and implement, but
                it resisted all attempts to break it until 1863, three centuries later. This earned it the description
                le chiffrage indéchiffrable (French for 'the indecipherable cipher'). Many people have tried to
                implement encryption schemes that are essentially Vigenère ciphers.[3] In 1863, Friedrich Kasiski was
                the first to publish a general method of deciphering Vigenère ciphers.

                In the 19th century, the scheme was misattributed to Blaise de Vigenère (1523–1596) and so acquired its
                present name.</p>
