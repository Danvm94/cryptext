### Further Testing

- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
- A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
- Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Fixed Bugs

- During the CSS validator testing, an error and two warnings were found:
  1. ![Parse Erro](./readme/css-validator-error-1.png)<br />
  Parse Error - The error was related to the code ".encrypt-box__radio-button:has(.encrypt-box__option:checked)". This error occurred because the CSS validator does not recognize the ":has" function. Upon further investigation, it was found that Firefox does not support the ":has" function, which may have caused the warning message.
  To address this issue, a different approach was taken by modifying the HTML and CSS code. More details about the changes made can be found in this [git commit](https://github.com/Danvm94/cryptext/commit/6949db9b48c8b17cbdbd7626581cef47582f3ca7).
  
  2. ![Warning](./readme/css-validator-warning-1.png)<br />
  CSS class .encrypt-box__radio-button, indicating "Same color for background-color and border-color". This warning occurred because the background-color and border-color were initially set to the same value. The reason for this was to address the issue of size changing when applying the border properties after the :checked selector.
  To resolve this warning, a modification was made in this [git commit](https://github.com/Danvm94/cryptext/commit/c6cfe59a9d01f0403b78e4cc6fd195b9ed2f1e3e). The solution involved applying a transparent color to the border-color property, ensuring a distinct visual separation while maintaining the desired design.

  3. ![Warning](./readme/css-validator-warning-2.png)<br />
